This folder holds stylesheet files that are registered for the '${skinname}'
Skin Selection only.

This folder is not meant for storing customizations of the default Plone
stylesheets. Use the ${namespace_package}_${package}_custom_styles directory
for that purpose.


Note
    Add stylesheets to this folder only if you have to make use of DTML with
    them.
    Stylesheet files that don't use DTML should be stored in and accessed from
    the 'browser' package as Zope 3 file resources.
