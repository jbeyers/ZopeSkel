Quick notes on todo for sprint left:

- change expert_mode into mode, so can pick easy, expert, or all

- split title -> namespaces for default

- write up proposal to divide project into zopeskel.base, zopeskel.plone, etc

- docs for new zopeskel command on plone.org

- auto html docs; show local commands

- think about right syntax for local commands--should this come out of bin/zopeskel?
  or should we have them use paster directly?
